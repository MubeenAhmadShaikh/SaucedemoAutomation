# Saucedemo Automation

The saucedemo.com website is a popular demo e-commerce platform developed by saucelabs where users can browse and purchase various products. To ensure the functionality and reliability of this website, it is essential to perform automated testing. This project aims to automate testing for saucedemo.com using Python, Selenium, Pytest, and the Page Objects Model. The project will include a range of features such as Data-Driven Tests, Cross-Browser Tests, Negative Tests, Logging Functionality and Report Generation using Allure Reports.
## Run using Docker Container

- Docker containers makes it easy to run the tests in a specific environment where you do not have to install anything specifically. Just pull the image and run simple command to run the tests.

```

| Parameter | Option     | Description                |
| :-------- |:-----------| :------------------------- |
| `pytest` | `required` | Pytest command to run the tests from terminal |
| `test_filename.py` | `optional` | To run the tests from specific file if not provided all the files with 'test_' or '_test' will be considered |
| `-s` | `optional` | for displaying console logs|
| `-v` | `optional` | for displaying additional details |
| `-m "marker_name"` | `optional` | To run the customised markers \| **Accepted values**: [positive, negative]|

## Generating Allure Reports

Allure command line should be installed in local system, to generate the Allure reports executed following command

```bash
pytest test_filename.py --alluredir="./path_to_generate_json_files"
```

Now once all the tests are completed and results are stored in JSON files we can run following to show the allure reports. 
```bash
allure serve '/path_of_generated_json_files'
```
